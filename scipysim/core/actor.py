    domain and number of an Actors inputs and outputs. As a convention 
    None means any number or any domain events are allowed.
    
    Class Attributes:

    num_outputs - Same but for output of a block.
    output_domains - a tuple or list exactly num_outputs long containing information 
                     about the domain of the output - None, DE, DT or CT, BIN
    input_domains - Same for inputs.
