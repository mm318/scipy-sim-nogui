    A Channel is based on the Python Queue, used for communicating between
    Actor threads.
    
    A Channel must be created for a specific domain, e.g.:
        * CT - Continuous Time
        * DT - Discrete Time
        * DE - Discrete Event
        
    @param domain: The two letter domain code as a string

        Blocks indefinitely when the channel is empty if 'block' is True
        and 'timeout' is None.

        Blocks for 'timeout' seconds when the channel is empty if 'block'
        is True and 'timeout' is a positive number. Raises an Empty exception
        if no item is available on timeout. A negative timeout is equivalent
        to setting 'block' equal to false.

        Raises an Empty exception if the channel is empty and 'block' is false.

        @param block: True if an empty channel should cause blocking.
        @param timeout: number of seconds to wait if blocked.
